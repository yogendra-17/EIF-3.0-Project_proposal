<br>

- SilentProof uses unique fusion of cryptography (distributed signatures) and signal processing (3D gesture tracking on a phone wallet) to provide **Proof of Liveliness**. The proof along with context verification algorithm (based on
proximity) will rule out **scalping, spoofing and spinning bots** and also bot farms where multiple phones are placed in co-located farming
units [5].

## Problem
- Bot farms challenge economics of tokenized assets.
83 percent of businesses surveyed experienced at least one bot attack within the past year. Out of that, 39 percent reporting a revenue loss greater than 10 percent. 
- NFTs are minted and then sold via auction on marketplaces. Bots are regularly used during online auctions, especially sniper bots, which will place a winning bid at the latest possible moment of the auction to increase the chances of winning an item at the lowest price.
- Scalpers use bots to manipulate the prices of NFTs, guaranteeing a sale at a favorable price and an even better resale value either through driving NFT prices down, driving NFT prices up or fake bidding.

## Idea and Architecture
The core idea of SilentProof is to exploit cyber-physical proofs and distributed signature (MPC) for denying bots from participating in any transaction.

<br>

- Whenever a transaction is initiated (say NFT Minting) through a dApp; two parallel signature processes are triggered:
    - dApp initiates distributed signature with a registered phone wallet. 
    - dApp frontend pops up a gif which suggests the user to replicate a gesture with the phone. This essentially is asking for the proof that the user is a hauman being- a) has necessary cognition to understand the motion shown in the gif, b) has possesion of the registered phone wallet and c) can move the phone as suggested. <br> <div align="center"> <img src="/double_flip_rGxyTdh.gif" height = "300px" width = "200px" /> </div> <div align="center"> *One of the suggested gesture to be replicated by the user.*</div>
    <br>
    - A multi-modal sensing algorithm triggers in the background at phone.
    - If the phone is moved by the user in the suggested fashion, Phone Wallet and dApp exchange messages to generate _distributed signatures_ with manifestation of the _proof of livelines_ and send the same to the smart contract.

## Core Concepts
As such there are two core concepts- generation distributed signatures between the dApp and the approving authority (registered phone wallet) and the very fact that this process is only triggered and the smart-contract is pushed with the expected signature, when the user has passed the check of _liveliness_.

- During registration, the dApp and phone wallet will undergo a distributed key generation.
- The signature generation is triggered with passing of the condition: _Replicate to prove that you are a human_:
    - The gesture detection is based on mapping the movement of the phone in 3D space using IMU sensors based sensing framework proposed by Sheng et.al. [4].

    <br>
- Prove that you (user accessing the dApp) and the registered phone wallet are in proximity: Apart from the check on the ability to replicate, an offline check also runs in parallel which verifies that the dApp and the phone wallet (phone), which trigger signature, are in same space (proximity i.e., near to each other). This is based on an encrypted offline channel using _inaudible acoustics_. The proximity checks nullifies remote signing/minting attempts or collusions.The developed algorithms also help to identify bots which are co-located using spatial and temporal data fusion across acoustic, radio frequency and sensory domains.

## Applications
- **Verified Mints**, similar to _blue ticks_ for verified accounts on twitter or other social network platforms: The NFTs which are minted through the Proof of Liveliness.
- Keep bots at bay during NFT launches.
- Deny bot click-farms from gaming metaverse economics.

## Integration with dApps
- No extra hardware requirement, a simple smartphone is good enough.
- Shipped with a Javascript library and Smartphone SDK (to be integrated with the phone wallet).
